## The task - Count number of times a string occur in a file


### Specification
Write a console program that takes one argument, a path to a file.
Open that file and count how many times its filename (minus the file extension) occurs in the file's contents.
Example: If the argument is "myfile.txt" it should count how many times the string "myfile" occurs in it.

Write this program to fulfill the specification correctly.
Make the code beautiful.
Think about everything that could go wrong, and handle that with good error messages.
Write tests that you think are needed.
If the specification isn't clear enough about what to do in situations, make an assumption and document it.
